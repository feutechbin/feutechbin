                    <h3>Additional Information</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pikachu is a short, chubby rodent Pok√©mon. It is covered in yellow fur with two horizontal brown stripes on its back. It has a small mouth, long, pointed ears with black tips, and brown eyes. Each cheek is a red circle that contains a pouch for electricity storage. It has short forearms with five fingers on each paw, and its feet each have three toes. At the base of its lightning bolt-shaped tail is a patch of brown fur. A female will have a V-shaped notch at the end of its tail, which looks like the top of a heart. It is classified as a quadruped, but it has been known to stand and walk on its hind legs; therefore, Pikachu is a facultative biped.</li>
                        <li>Pikachu has sixteen additional forms that fall into four groups: Cosplay Pikachu, Pikachu in a cap, the partner Pikachu, and Gigantamax Pikachu. Additionally, many other Pikachu variants have appeared in various media.</li>
